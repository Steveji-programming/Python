Hi everybody! 

Here is Python notes for beginner and novice. In these notes, we will discuss the basic functions, data structures and programming in Python. For example, I've posted some of the data structure in python: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries...
Also, if you're already learned the basics, I added some intermediate parts for you: Object-oriented programming, fundamental data structure implements in Python... 
The concepts of notes will be very easy to understand, and I added explanations beside every key points, so all the beginner wouldn't be confused at this time.

Hope you like it!
